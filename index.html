        <p> which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of a webpage by using a series of elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.
            <br>HTML is not considered a programming language as it cannot create dynamic functionality, but it is now considered an official web standard maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
